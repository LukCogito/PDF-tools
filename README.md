# PDF-tools
Tools for PDF editing

## TO DO:
- Deal with unintended line breaks and other stuff; make the text mobi or epub like
    + The ideal output would be txt file where one line is one paragraph of text in original PDF
    + I have an idea of using spacy for word tokenization and filtering empty line breaks, page numbers, repeating name of authors or chapters; it's not implemented yet
